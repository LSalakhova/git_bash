# ðŸ“Œ Bash

Here I'd like to share some of the examples of sending basic commands with bash that i've used:

  1. [Basic Commands with Bash. Example 1](https://github.com/LSalakhova/git_bash/blob/main/bash1.txt)

     The purpose of the assignment was a work with files and directories.
     
  3. [Basic Commands with Bash. Example 2](https://github.com/LSalakhova/git_bash/blob/main/bash2.txt)

     The purpose of the assignment was editing files, checking and killing proccesses, working with the following websites: [rusau.net](https://rusau.net/) and [petstore.swagger.io](https://petstore.swagger.io/).
